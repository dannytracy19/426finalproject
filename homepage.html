                    <h5 class="subtitle has-text-grey">Order of importance of each element</h5>
                    <p>When it comes to design and specifically typography (which is a massive part of web design), you
                        want
                        your content to be readable. This means that when someone looks at it, they intuitively know
                        which text to read first, second, and third.
                        If all of the text on the page was the same size, it would be difficult to know which
                        information is the most important.</p>
                    <p>Size is one key way in which typographers create hierarchy and guide their readers.
                        Headings are usually large, sub-headings are smaller, and body type is smaller still.
                        Size is not the only way to define hierarchy – it can also be achieved with colour, spacing and
                        weight.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="column">
                    <h1 class="title">Measure</h1>
                    <h5 class="subtitle has-text-grey">The width of a line of text</h5>
                    <p>The term 'measure' describes the width of a text block. If you're seeking to achieve the optimum
                        reading experience,
                        it's clearly an important consideration. If your lines are too long, your reader can easily get
                        lost,
                        while a too-short measure breaks up the reading experience unnecessarily.</p>
                    <p>
                        There are a number of theories to help you define the ideal measure for your typography.
                        One rule of thumb is that your lines should be 2-3 alphabets in length (so 52-78 characters,
                        including spaces). Bulma's container class
                        does this for us.</p>
